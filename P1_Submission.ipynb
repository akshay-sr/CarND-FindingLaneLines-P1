    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "Identifying lane lines with separeted line-segments\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------\n",
    "1. To identify the lanes correctly for all images, I modified the Canny threshold as follows\n",
    "low_threshold = 100\n",
    "high_threshold = 250 \n",
    "\n",
    "to eliminate spurious edges other than the lanes themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I then had to mask the canny edge output image to only contain the region of interest defined by the \n",
    "\n",
    "vertices defined by the trapezoidal limits containing the lanes as two non-parallel sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The HoughLinesP parameters were as follows:\n",
    "rho=2,\n",
    "theta=pi/180,\n",
    "threshold=15 (hough grid cell votes),\n",
    "min_line_length=5 and\n",
    "max_line_gap=10.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The lines themselves are weighted with the color image to produce the overlay of the red line lanes.\n",
    "I used a thickness=5 to draw the lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, to display the image in JPEG in the right color channels, I had flip it from what matplotlib uses \n",
    "\n",
    "(using numpy.fliplr)\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding line extrapolation\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "1. I first threshold the slope to include candidates that satisfy a range of angles of inclination.\n",
    "I chose between 25-75 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The extrapolation itself involves preparing a vector of contiguous segments, with the common end point \n",
    "\n",
    "being the midpoint of the line-segment.\n",
    "Thus, if the original line-segments are \n",
    "(x11,y11,x12,y12),\n",
    "(x21, y21, x22, y22),\n",
    "(x31, y31, x33, y33)\n",

    "((x11+x12)/2, (x12+y12)/2, (x21+x22)/2, (y21+y22)/2),\n",

    "The algorithm can be improved in extarpolating solid lines where line-segments with similar slope can be in \n",
    "\n",
    "parallel and non-collinear. In such a case, computing the midpoints of these segments and connecting them \n",
    "\n",
    "could result in spurious zig-zag lines that needs to be avoided.\n"
